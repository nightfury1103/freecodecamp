# # Medical Data Visualizer

# ## Note
#
# This is cool. But I guess I prefer to visualize data with d3, it feels more
# easier to me. We can also get some interactive charts instead of static
# images.
#
# Total time: 2h
#
# Damn, why can't I be faster, it's only about Google and reading document

# ## Problem description
#
# Content of this section is copied and reformatted from [this
# repl.it](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-medical-data-visualizer),
# provided by FCC
# [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer).
#
# ### Assignment
#
# In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical
# examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were
# collected during medical examinations.
#
# #### Data description
#
# The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information
# like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices.
# You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease,
# body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
#
# File name: medical_examination.csv

#
# #### Tasks
#
# Create a chart similar to `examples/Figure_1.png`, where we show the counts of
# good and bad outcomes for the `cholesterol`, `gluc`, `alco`, `active`, and
# `smoke` variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.
#
# Use the data to complete the following tasks in `medical_data_visualizer.py`:
#
# - Add an `overweight` column to the data. To determine if a person is
#   overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by
#   the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is
#   overweight. Use the value 0 for NOT overweight and the value 1 for overweight.
# - Normalize the data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of
#   `cholesterol` or `gluc` is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1,
#   make the value 1.
# - Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value
#   counts of the categorical features using seaborn's `catplot()`. The dataset
#   should be split by 'Cardio' so there is one chart for each `cardio` value. The
#   chart should look like `examples/Figure_1.png`.
# - Clean the data. Filter out the following patient segments that represent
#   incorrect data:
#   - diastolic pressure is higher than systolic (Keep the correct data with
#     `(df['ap_lo'] <= df['ap_hi'])`)
#   - height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with
#     `(df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025))`)
#   - height is more than the 97.5th percentile
#   - weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
#   - weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
# - Create a correlation matrix using the dataset. Plot the correlation matrix
#   using seaborn's `heatmap()`. Mask the upper triangle. The chart should look
#   like `examples/Figure_2.png`.
#
# Any time a variable is set to `None`, make sure to set it to the correct code.


# ## Solution


import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# ### Import data

df = pd.read_csv("./medical_examination.csv")

# ### Add 'overweight' column

df["overweight"] = np.where(
    df["weight"] / (df["height"] * df["height"]) * 10000 > 25,
    1,
    0,
)

# Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of
# 'cholesterol' or 'gluc' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1,
# make the value 1.

df["cholesterol"] = np.where(df["cholesterol"] == 1, 0, 1)
df["gluc"] = np.where(df["gluc"] == 1, 0, 1)


# ### Draw Categorical Plot


def draw_cat_plot():
    # Create DataFrame for cat plot using `pd.melt` using just the values from
    # 'cholesterol', 'gluc', 'smoke', 'alco', 'active', and 'overweight'.
    vars = sorted(
        ["cholesterol", "gluc", "smoke", "alco", "active", "overweight"]
    )

    df_cat = pd.melt(
        df,
        id_vars=["cardio"],
        value_vars=vars,
    )

    # Group and reformat the data to split it by 'cardio'. Show the counts of
    # each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the catplot
    # to work correctly.
    df_cat = df_cat.value_counts().reset_index(name="total")

    # Draw the catplot with 'sns.catplot()'
    fig = sns.catplot(
        data=df_cat,
        x="variable",
        y="total",
        hue="value",
        col="cardio",
        kind="bar",
        order=vars,
    )
    fig.set_ylabels("total")
    fig.set_xlabels("variable")
    fig = fig.fig

    # Do not modify the next two lines
    # fig.savefig("catplot.png") # Don't save to file
    return fig


# ### Draw Heat Map


def draw_heat_map():
    # Clean the data
    df_heat = df.loc[
        (df["ap_lo"] <= df["ap_hi"])
        & (df["height"] >= df["height"].quantile(0.025))
        & (df["height"] <= df["height"].quantile(0.975))
        & (df["weight"] >= df["weight"].quantile(0.025))
        & (df["weight"] <= df["weight"].quantile(0.975))
    ]

    # Calculate the correlation matrix
    corr = df_heat.corr()

    # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
    mask = np.zeros_like(corr)
    mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True

    # Set up the matplotlib figure
    # with sns.axes_style("white"):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 9))

    # Draw the heatmap with 'sns.heatmap()'
    ax = sns.heatmap(
        corr,
        mask=mask,
        vmax=0.4,
        square=True,
        fmt=".1f",
        annot=True,
    )

    # Do not modify the next two lines
    # fig.savefig("heatmap.png")
    # Don't save to file
    return fig
